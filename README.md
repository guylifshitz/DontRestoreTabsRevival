# Build and install
To run this code, simply ZIP the file and change the filename and extension to "dontRestoreTabsRevival.xpi". Then install on Thunderbird with "Install add-on from file".

# Testing
To test, open some e-mails and close/exit Thunderbird. Then re-open Thunderbird and all the tabs you had open previously open should be closed.
